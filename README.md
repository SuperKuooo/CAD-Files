# CAD_Files
Here are most of the CAD designs I have made from time to time.

- I am still trying to upload my previous work. Some of them are in different computers so it might take some time.
- Some of the files I do not have the final version, or perhaps have lost it. I will try to update them and keep them organized as I go.
- Most files are in sldprt files, but I know they are not really viewable that way so I will try to make a SDL copy with in the folders for quick reference.
